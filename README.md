Haskell types for OpenAPI 3.0.0. 

Available as a Hackage package: [`openapi-typed`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/openapi-typed ). 

## Usage

The types follow the following opinonated conventions and deviations from the standards:

- Each OpenAPI object represented as `data` provides the following:
  - Docstring showing how the constructor works
  - Constructor with fields named using the convention `_<data>_field`
  - Derivation of `Eq` for each data class
  - Derivation of `Show` for each data class
  - Derivation of `ToJSON` for each data class
  - Derivation of `FromJSON` for each data class
  - Getter for each field using the convention `get<data><field>`, where the field is capitalized, ie `getPathItemSummary`
  - Setter for each field using the convention `set<data><field>`, where the field is capitalized, ie `setPathItemSummary`
  - `either` function for all datatypes with multiple construtors that take a single argument using the convention `either<data><constructor>`, ie `eitherReferenceOrRef`
- Adds the possibility to use `x-` extensions on almost all objects, as this happens a lot in the wild.
- Changes the `items` type in shema to accept a tuple in addition to a schema and a reference.

## Development

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/meeshkan/openapi-typed.git`
1. Move into the directory:  `cd openapi-typed`
1. Set up your local environment: You can use this guide from [The Haskell Tool Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) for reference

### Running tests 

The tests show how to use this library to parse the [Slack](https://slack.com) and [Stripe](https://stripe.com) OpenAPI specs.

To execute the tests, run:

```bash
stack test
```
